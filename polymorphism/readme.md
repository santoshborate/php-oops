Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms.
polymorphism or polyphormism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types.
Polymorphism is one of the OOPs feature that allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

 It is defining functions that have similar signatures, yet have different parameters. 
 
**Overriding:**

It is only pertinent to derived classes, where the parent class has defined a method and the derived class wishes to override that method
