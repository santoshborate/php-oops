Inheritance is nothing but a design principle in oop. By implementing inheritance you can inherit(or get) all properties and methods of one class to another class.The class who inherit feature of another class known as child class.The class which is being inherited is know as parent class.Concept of the inheritance in oop is same as inheritance in real world. For example, child inherits characteristics  of their parent. Same is here in oop. One class is inheriting characteristics of another class.

2. Hierarchical Inheritance - when more than one derived class are created from a single base class, then that inheritance is called as hierarchical inheritance.
3. Multilevel Inheritance - when a derived class is created from another derived class, then that inheritance is called as multi level inheritance. 
4. Hybrid Inheritance - Any combination of single, hierarchical and multi level inheritances is called as hybrid inheritance. 
5. Multiple Inheritance - when a derived class is created from more than one base class then that inheritance is called as multiple inheritance.
